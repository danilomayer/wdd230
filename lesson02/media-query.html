                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

                will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh,
                that he may know according to the flesh how to csuccor his people according to their infirmities.</p>
